The generated data spanning five years (Testing Data: 2018-2022; Training Data: 2023) with a Poisson distribution provides a good foundation for model training and testing. 

The R-squared value of 0.76 indicates a moderately strong fit between the predicted and actual values, capturing a significant portion of the data's variability. 

The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 18.17% suggests some discrepancies between predicted and observed values, however, we believe that our model's performance remains satisfactory as the average percentage deviation of values is relatively low. 

The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 27.97 indicates the average magnitude of these discrepancies, which is relatively low compared to the range of the data.
